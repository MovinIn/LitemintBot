# LitemintBot
Uses The Litemint API to play opponents online. It uses a simple algorithm to defeat opponents. 

At 150 season wins, this is the deck it uses:

deck = new String[]
    {
      "card_dex_00001"
      ,"card_dex_00018"
      ,"card_dex_00029"
      ,"card_dex_00026"
      ,"card_dex_00033"
      ,"card_dex_00005"
      ,"card_dex_00016"
      ,"card_dex_00002"
      ,"card_dex_00051"
      ,"card_dex_00068"
    };

It requires a TOKEN to use. Enter in your TOKEN from Developer Tools into the console when starting the application. I would advise using an alt account, as the bot has some faults and does not play optimally...
